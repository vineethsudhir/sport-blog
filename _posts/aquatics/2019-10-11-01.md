 Two-time US Olympian Conor Dwyer was suspended by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for testing positive for an anabolic agent in out-of-competition tests collected on November 15, November 27, and December 20, 2018. The decision came from an independent three-member panel of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), who determined Dwyer, 30, should receive a 20-month suspension.

Dwyerâ€™s 20-month period of ineligibility started on December 21, 2018, which would explain why he had to withdraw from the 2019 World Championship team this year without explanation. The timing suggests USA Swimming must have known about the case before Gwangju but said nothing, drawing parallels to Swimming Australia and Shayna Jack.

He will not be eligible to swim at the 2020 Olympic Trials since his suspension will cede in August 2020, ruling out his chances at a third Olympic berth.
