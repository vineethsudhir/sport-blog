# It's time India consistently raise levels to become an Asian force, says Gurpreet Singh Sandhu

Consistency is the key in the development of anything, said Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. India's and Bengaluru FC's no.1 goalkeeper, who recently signed up as a PUMA athlete, was excited about the future of the Indian National team and says he has thoroughly enjoyed his time back in India, playing for Bengaluru FC.

In an interaction with Sportskeeda recently, Gurpreet shed light on a terrific season for him, as he won his first ISL title with Bengaluru FC when the Blues beat FC Goa 1-0 in the final at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Gurpreet talks about the impression that new India coach Igor Stimac has created, about his aims for next season, and what India need to do to improve and consistently be a force at the Asian level.
