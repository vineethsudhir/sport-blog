Anil Kumble has been appointed as the head coach of IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab starting the 2020 season. Kumble's appointment comes on the back of Mike Hesson's exit from the ranks halfway into his two-year contract.

Kumble has previously served as India's head coach in 2016-17 but this will be his first coaching role with an IPL franchise. He was involved as a player and captain with Royal Challengers Bangalore before joining the team as a mentor later on. He would then serve as the mentor of Mumbai Indians in the lead up to his India coaching stint, which ended on a rather acrimonious note.

KXIP finished sixth in 2019 IPL, a slight improvement on the seventh position they finished in 2018.
